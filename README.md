### Forewords 
This code is a proof of concept designed to solve a minimal-time transfer problems on the special unitary group $SU(d)$ applied to the control of driftless closed quantum systems, as detailled in [Janković et al. (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21203). 

This code is written in the JAX ecosystem using Python version `3.14.0`. The solver is based on a natural gradient descent in the discretize-then-optimize paradigm, also known as direct method.

### Getting started 
Open the terminal and run
```
git clone https://github.com/killianlutz/pyMagicarp.git
```

Activate the virtual environment 
```
source magicarp/bin/activate
```

Run the optimizer
```
python -m scripts.main
```

### Mathematical details
We are given $m$ orthonormal control Hamiltonians $H_1, \ldots, H_m$ generating the Lie algebra of $SU(d)$ and a target special unitary gate $U_{\mathrm{target}}$. We then optimize for the self-adjoint traceless matrix $g$ minimizing

$$T = \sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^m \mathrm{Tr}\left(H_{j}g\right)^2}$$

subject to the constraint that the solution $U_g(\cdot)$ of

$$\dot{U} = -\mathrm{i}\sum_{j=1}^m \mathrm{Re} \mathrm{Tr}\left(U^\dagger H_{j}U g\right)H_j U, \quad 0 < t < 1$$

starting at $U(0) = I$ reaches the target at time $t = 1$, that is $U_g(1) = U_{\mathrm{target}}$.

**Caveats**: at the moment, the solver only solves for a control $g$ such that $U_g(1) = U_{\mathrm{target}}$.
